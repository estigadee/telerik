Sum Positive

Write a program that reads a positive integer (n) You must print the sum of all integers from 1 to n.
Hint

    You could use the formula sum = n(n+1)/2*

Input

    On the first line you will receive a number (n)

Output

    You should print the sum of the integers from 1 to n

Interest

You have deposited a sum into your bank account for 3 years. The bank has announced an interest of 5% per year. Each time the interest is calculated and added to your deposit. You have to calculate the amount in your deposit for each year.
Input

    On the only line you will receive a number (n) with the sum deposited

Output

    You should print the amount in your deposit for each of the 3 years

Constraints

    You must print the number with two numbers after the decimal point. The rules of math for rounding apply here

Input

Arithmetics

Read two numbers from the console and calculate:

    The sum of a and b
    The difference when a is subtracted from b
    The product of a and b
    The remainder when a is divided by b
    The result of a powered to b

Input

    On the first line you will receive a number a
    On the second line you will receive a number b

Output

    You should print the sum, the difference, the product the remainder and the power

Converter

You want to buy this really cool car from the UK, but you are worried about the fuel consumption. The values you see are MPG (miles per gallon). You have no idea what 20 MPG means so, being a programmer, decide to write a converter that helps you calculate the consumption.

Doing some research, you learn that 1 gallon = 4.54 litres and 1 mile = 1.6 km.

After the calculation, round the result down to the neareast whole number.
Input

    On the first line you will receive a number m - miles per galon

Output

    On the only line of output, print {result} litres per 100 km

Constraints

    1 <= m <= 100

Input

20

Output

14 litres per 100 km

Input

44

Output

6 litres per 100 km

Time

Write a program that reads days, hours, minutes and seconds from the standard input. Display the total amount of seconds.
Input

    First line - d - days
    Second line - h - hours
    Third line - m - minutes
    Fourth line - s - seconds

Output

    On the only line of output, print the total amount of seconds

Constraints

    0 <= d, h, m, s <= 1000

Input

Sum Digits

Write a program that reads a four-digit number and displays the sum of its digits

    1213 => 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 7
    2346 => 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 15

Input

    On the first line, you will receive the four-digit number N

Output

    On the only line of output, print the sum of digits

Constraints

    1000 <= N <= 9999

Input

2346

Output

15
